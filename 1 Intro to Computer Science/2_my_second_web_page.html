<center> <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1> </center>
<p class = "small">Ada Lovelace, whose claim to fame is being one of the first
computer programmers, was born December 10, 1815 in London. She 
was the only legimate child of Byron who shortly divorced her
mother. Byron died when Lovelace was 8 years old and her mother strongly encouraged
her interest in math and logical reasoning because she didn't 
want her to be like her father who was thought to have been
insane. </p>

<p class = "small">Lovelace was fascinated by the functionality of the human brain and
strived to create a mathematical model to describe it. Altough she never
reached that goal, she did leave a legacy in the math field nonetheless.
Captivated by Babbage's difference engine, she aided him in his design of a 
theoretical analytical engine that went beyond pure math calculations. She 
created the first algorithm designed for a computer which would compute 
Bernoulli numbers. Unfortunately, the engine was never finished, but it's 
speculated her algorithm would've worked if it had been.
</p>

<p class = "small">The analytical engine provided significant implications
to the mathematical and programming community, as it proved computers
were more than just number crunching machines. It was the first stepping
stone towards the modern computer that is much more than the simple 
calculator computers were at the time. This amazing engine brought the realization that anything
could be converted to numbers, even music.
