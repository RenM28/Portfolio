<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> 
Howdy! My name is Lauren Gernes, but my friends call me Ren! I'm a Junior majoring in math and secondary education. In the future, I'd like to be a high school math teacher.
After grad school, I'm considering also being a professor at a community college. I can't wait to learn more about coding in this class!
</p>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
<p>
In my free time, I like to crochet. My brother's girlfriend crocheted me a whale as a gift for getting my wisdom teeth out. I loved it so much that I wanted to learn
how to make my own animals. After practicing different stitches by watching Youtube tutorials, I started on my first project. I made a little stuffed whale keychain to put
on my lanyard with my key and ID. It was a little rough, but it made me proud. From there, I started crocheting stuffed animals for all my close friends. I think the most 
satisfying part of crocheting is seeing my friends' smile when they receive the finished product. So far, I've only made stuffed animals, but I'm currently working on creating
a small rug. I'd like to eventually branch out and try all sorts of projects.

<h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
<p>
<ul style="text-align:center; list-style-position:inside;">
<li> How to use loops
<li> How to solve mathematical problems using code
<li> How to graph equations in python
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Greatest Innovation</h2>
<p>
I believe the greatest innovation in technology is the invention of open source
software and services. Before open sources came along, companies like Microsoft could monopolize
and overcharge for software and other services since competition was few and far between. Once other developers were given access
to create and sell software, prices began to drop and more people had access to the wealth 
of information the internet provides today. People can also use open source platforms to share
information more readily with sites like Wikipedia. This has allowed our world to be more connected than it was before,
although there is now more doubt about the credibility of the information we read. Although open source sites may have their problems,
I think their costs are worth the greater interconnectedness we have today.
