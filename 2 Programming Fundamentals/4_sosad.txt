I'm so sad right now
Too late, calm down
I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now
Too late, calm down
If I make it through the night, I'ma be alright
But I'm so sad right now
So long, old friend
We'll meet again
Some time, somehow
I'm so sad right now
I miss havin' fun, I miss my mom and dad
I miss bein' happy, I miss what we had
But most of all, I miss the feelings that I used to have
I wish someone could tell me why I'm so sad
Sometimes I get so sad I cry
I don't know why I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now
Too late, calm down
I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now
It's okay to be sad sometimes
It's okay to be sad sometimes, yeah
It's okay to be sad sometimes
It's okay to be sad sometimes, yeah
